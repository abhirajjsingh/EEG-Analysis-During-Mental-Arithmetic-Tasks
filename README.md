## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- MNE
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/eeg-binary-classification.git
    cd eeg-binary-classification
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**:
    - Load the EEG data for rest and task states.
    - Preprocess the data (e.g., filtering, epoching, normalization).
    - Split the data into training and validation sets.

2. **Define EEGNet Model**:
    - Create the EEGNet model architecture.
    - Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

3. **Train EEGNet Model**:
    - Train the EEGNet model using the training data.
    - Validate the model using the validation data.

4. **Define TSCeption Model**:
    - Create the TSCeption model architecture.
    - Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

5. **Train TSCeption Model**:
    - Train the TSCeption model using the training data.
    - Validate the model using the validation data.

6. **Evaluate Models**:
    - Use the validation data to evaluate the models.
    - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Architecture

### EEGNet

EEGNet is designed specifically for EEG signal classification tasks. It uses convolutional layers to capture spatial and temporal features from the EEG signals.

### TSCeption

TSCeption is designed for time-series classification. It uses multiple convolutional layers with different kernel sizes to capture features at various temporal scales.

## Training and Validation

- Train the models on the training data.
- Validate the models on the validation data.
- Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

## Evaluation Metrics

Evaluate the models using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the modelâ€™s predictions.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
